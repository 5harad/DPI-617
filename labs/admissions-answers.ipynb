Second, we assume that [students accepted to top-tier law schools](https://abovethelaw.com/2013/03/which-law-schools-had-the-highest-yield-rate/) all decided to enroll at a top-tier school. Finally, we assume that admissions decisions are based on a relatively small set of factors that we have access to: LSAT score, GPA, minority status, and family income. This is a coarse approximation of actual admissions policies, but is instructive nevertheless.\n",
